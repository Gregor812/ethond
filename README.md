# Metrotek EthOnd board

Metrotek EthOnd is Altera SoC based development board with 2 GigE ports.

This board was developed for internal needs of the STC Metrotek company and is a working prototype for the next intelligent ethernet testing device.

The main feature of this board is SoC (System On Chip), which combines FPGA and ARM processor that can solve many specific problems. For example, to perform an analysis of the ethernet under any load or design your own graphic accelerator. However, the device's capabilities do not stop there. 
On the board are installed two GigE interface, micro-SD card slot, mini-USB with OTG support and PLD-connectors for expansion boards.


Currently this project is described only in Russian.
